    <p>WE  OBJECTIVES</p>

<p>WE  CODE OF  ETHICS</p>

<p>TO  SHOW my faith in the worthiness of my vocation by industrious application to the end that l may merit a reputation for quality of service. 
TO SEEK success and to demand all fair remuneration or profit as my just due, but to accept no  profit or success at the price of my own self – respect lost because of unfair advantage taken or because of questionable acts on my part. 
TO REMEMBER that in building up own business it is not necessary to tear down another’s; to be loyal to my clients or customers and true to myself.

ALWAYS  to bear in mind my obligations as a citizen of  my Nation, my State and my community, and to give them freely of my time, labour and means. 
TO AID my fellowmen by giving my sympathy to those in distress, my aid to the weak, and my substance to the needy. 
TO BE CAREFUL with my criticism and liberal with my praise, to build up and not destroy.

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>1. Major Service Activity

  <li>A Strong Membership Development and Retention Programme 
Immediate indoctrination &amp; involvement of new members in club project &amp; continuing involvement of current members is the essential key to high membership retention. Individual members should be encouraged to develop and attract new members into the club. Both the club

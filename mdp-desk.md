Namaskar Dear We Members,

I feel very happy and content to be part of our prestigious WE Association. I thank all of you for reposing your trust in me and I shall leave no stone unturned in my sincere efforts in fulfilling my duties. I would like to take the opportunity of thanking our Senior most members WE Kawal Rekhi, WE Yasmin Dotivala, WE Raxa Mehta, WE Usha Joya and Nirmal Mathur ji for their valuable guidance . How can I forget late Marookji I , who has always been by my side . I , cannot , but thank enough the members of my Home Club WE CLUB OF CHEMBUR and trustees for their whole hearted support . I also thank members of WE CLUB OF VILE PARLE and I am proud of their enthusiasm and fervour and solidarity that they have shown me.

It is my proud privilege to be part of District 323 A2. It is here that I learnt that it is my duty to do something for the society which has given me so much. I am grateful to each and every member of my Home District Last, but quite the most important , it is because of my family that I stand here today. My husband, Mr Santosh Mekal and my son Swapnil Mekal have, for the past 35 years, positively nurtured my passion for service. After my son's marriage my daughter in law Dhanashri and now even my grand daughter Saesha have supported me in all my WE ventures. 

WE Friends , I believe in the words of Abraham Lincoln that _"Commitment is what transforms a promise into a reality"_.

Let us all strive to achieve our common goal of EPITOME OF SERVICE by working together as a team and take our own WE to greater heights by achieving more. Let us try to extend a helping hand to as many needy people as we can.

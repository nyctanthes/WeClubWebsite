"WE Club of New Panvel started a Project of Community service centre at New Panvel Gurudwara. Under this project , a cupboard has been kept at Gurudwara premises, where any one can come and just keep the things which they do not need, but is in usable condition. Once in a while on Sunday (Langar day ) the goods so collected are displayed on a table . Needy people are welcomed to come and pickup whatever they need without asking for it. People whole heartedly contribute goods. And Gurdwara management committee gives their full support to carry out the activity.This is a continuous project . Panvelkars have ensured that our cupboard never runs empty."

Hedutane is an Adivasi village located in Raigad district of Maharashtra, Taluka Panvel, Gram panchayat Kanpoli. This particular hillock in the village has a population of around 100. The borewell located right at the bottom gets water through out the year. Residents had to carry the water manually on top every day as per their day to day requirement. Our Club , WE club of Chembur , along with the Plan executing team from WE club of New Panvel Steel Town took up the task.

WE association provided the villagers with pipeline from borewell to top of the hillock. A sintax tank of 5000 liter capacity was installed on top. And a separate pipe line from top to down was laid, having stand posts with 2 taps each were constructed. Few families together share each stand post.

Fork lift driving Training was given to 6 ladies who had participated in our earlier project of Free four wheeler driving training . Earlier 20 ladies were trained for four wheeler driving . The project was sponsored by Ceat Tyres and Godrej Vikhroli. Six ladies from the same batch opted to go further for Fork lift driving training too. Its really nice to see that 3 ladies from this batch are today working at IKEA Turbhe as Fork Lift operators.

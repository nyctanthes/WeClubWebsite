The ZP school of Karambeli and Anganwadi school had open veranda, which was in use as classroom. Being a open space with a asbestos cover on top, the place had many unwanted visitors like Cows, dogs, hen and birds. After school hours these animals use to make the place unusable, without cleaning, conducting the regular class next day was just impossible. To solve this issue WE CLUB OF NEW PANVEL and WE Club Of Chembur , came to their rescue by installing Grill Cover for all 4 open Verandas. To reach the classroom's height comfortably , concrete slope along with railing was provided for all class rooms.

To introduce our club members to villagers, a formal get together , Haldi kumkum for village ladies was arranged. After a small introduction , snacks,sweets and steel plates were given to all ladies present. Around 75 in numbers. During this meeting we identified 15 such families of senior citizens, who had no kids and were not earning themselves either. In short were fully dependent on villagers for their day to day needs. WE gifted them with Diwali Hamper a bag containing Rice, Dal, Sugar, Tea, Oil, a box of Sweets etc. The gift was sponsored by a wellwisher Mrs Pratima Gangwal from Pune. WE Urmila Kumawat sponsored 1kg packet of Dry Khichadi to 80 families. Biscuits were distributed amongst kids.

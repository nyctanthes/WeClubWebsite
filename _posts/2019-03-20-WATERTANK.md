 WE club of NPST's adopted village Karembeli , Taluka Panvel was facing acute water shortage since many years. WE members along with villagers, identified a spot on the top of a hill, where accumulated rain water was available almost whole year. WE District, constructed a small reservoir ,from where water was broght down through the pipeline upto the storage tank in the village. Thus the fetching water distance of around 2 kilometers came to an end. 

 Seven Stand posts with bucket rest with two taps was constructed at various locations in the entire village. Around 10 families shares a single Stand post. Happy to solve the basic problem of the villagers.

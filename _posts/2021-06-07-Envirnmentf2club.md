We plant trees and cut down old trees for years. Digging out the fertile land and digging up the luxurious buildings of big bricks and stonesLet's make it stand up. The whole country digs from Kashmir to Kanyakumari and divides the Ratnagarbha land, only stars iron don't know what they have put and hope that Vasundhara gives happiness.. How is this possible.. Take a resolution today, plant them trees. Take care till you become and get life...!! We Diamond Nirmala ji did this great work

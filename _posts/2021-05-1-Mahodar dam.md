Rural Development Project by WE Club of Chembur, District 323 A2. Coordinated buy WE Club of NPST. Water scarcity in Maharashtra has reached a crises situation. There are around 4,900 villages and more
than 10,500 hamlets in our state where water tankers supply limited water for drinking purpose once or
twice a week. Just before this monsoon this year we faced one of the acute water shortage in many
districts like Beed, Satara, Aurangabad. There are many villages and hamlets in our district too which
face similar problem.

Since past few years our organisation is regularly doing projects in Panvel's surrounding villages. During such visits we observed that one of the biggest problem faced by these adivasis is of WATER. By February end the wells go dry. Ladies and children, specially girl child travel more than a kilometer on hilly path, to fetch water.
Even though the forest department has allocated them land for farming , they can not do so in absence
of water. They are forced to move out and work as labourers. It has devasted villagers agricultural
based livelihood. They find it difficult to save the cattles from starving. It's a chained effect which
affects everyone.


Scientists have predicted that with continuously rising temperature, and global warming the Asian
region will face severe water shortage in near future. Banglore city is one such example in front of us.
Even though the area gets abundant rain supply which is in range of 3500 mm to 3800 mm every year,
there exists SHORTAGE. The ponds and small natural reservoirs gets filled to its full capacity and
overflow during monsoon. But as the rain stops , the water so accumulated slowly gets drained. This
natural draining is the result of slopping and topography. The Sahyadri hill range and several hillocks gives rise to higher run off, rather than natural recharge.


After a deep study we found that Rain water harvesting, village ponds, individual tanks, conservation of ground water and the most importantly Regulating the flow of spring discharge can be effective in hilly areas. We realised that we need to find a clever solution to ensure that there is enough water for all.DAM CONSTRUCTION


Project ready and in use. Inauguration pending due to current Covid situation.

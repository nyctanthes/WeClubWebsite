A cupboard has been kept at their premises where any one can come and just keep the things which they do not need, but in usable condition. Once in a while on Sunday (Langar day ) the goods so collected are displayed on a table and needy people are welcomed to come and pickup whatever they need without asking for it. People whole heartedly contribute goods. And Gurdwara management committee give their full support to carry out the activity.

This is a continuous project . Panvelkars have ensured that our cupboard never runs empty.

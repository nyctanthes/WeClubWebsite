 Extreme rainfall this year, across India has caused many havocs. But friends Water is one of the most precious gifts of nature. So when nature gives us anything so important in abundance, we should preserve it. Since 2018 WE CLUB of  New Panvel Steel town  has diverted it's attention towards WATER.  WE District 323 A2 did a project in our adopted village Karambeli where  a small reservoir on hill top was constructed, from where water gets diverted to the village storage tank. Multiple stand posts were made to take water, right upto their doorstep.

Now in 2019 , WE club of NPST is concentrating on Rain water Harvesting project. Here  we divert the rain water falling from building terrace to the borewell after filtering. We installed it at 4 different locations so far.

The simplest method is to store the water for future use. Our club president WE SWARNLATA IYER ,  got two water reservoirs (शेत तळ) constructed at village Wavarle, Chouk , Taluka khalapur , which is nearly 25 km from Panvel.

One reservoir is of 22 lac liter capacity, and the bigger one is with holding capacity of 45 lac liter. The cost of construction is 2.4 lacs and 3.2 lacs respectively. 

There are 275 families with a population of 1375 in this village.

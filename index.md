 <span style="font-family:Papyrus; font-size:4em;">Woman</span> embodies power and strength, she plays multifaceted roles- she is a friend, a mother, a teacher and a mentor. She is a defining factor that can bring about any change in the society. She is a learner, an achiever, a leader. She is like water - one who can blend in any situation and come out a winner. She is the one who is empowered to imprint the best in young minds.
 
She is the symbol of love, compassion, emotional strength and courage.

The Association of “WE” Clubs of India is a non-profit NGO and is registered as a trust which will focus its services for the betterment of society. 

There is no exercise better for the heart than reaching down and lifting people up to brighten their lives. We are in this together. Let's draw strength from each other. Let's make sure we share positive energy, while we create a world of our vision - A world where we are free to be who we want to be, and with whom we want to be, without fear.

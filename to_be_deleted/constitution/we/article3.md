# Sponsorship

When 12 or more  Clubs are sponsored by WE  District and recognised by the WE Multiple,  the District Cabinet of the said WE  District may approve the formation of a corresponding WE District. The WE District if so established shall include all officially recognized  WE Clubs within the territorial boundaries of the WE District. 

A single WE Club can be a part of WE Multiple District by contributing subscription per member.

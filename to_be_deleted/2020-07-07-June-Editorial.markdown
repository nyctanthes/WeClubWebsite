Work is an essential part of being alive.

It is our identity, whatever we ask of God let us also work for it.
Saksham (Capability) is dedicated to the working force of all the
service minded people who collectively work for the civic, cultural,
social and moral welfare of the community without any personal or
financial rewards. It refects the tremendous work put in by WE Club
community.


We genuinely want to thank our Multiple District President WE Saroja Mekal for reposing faith in us and giving us a free hand in designing and editing the WE Club Multiple District Directory.

We do hope we have lived up to her expectations.
We must mention the matchless devotion of Lion Keshav Shetty
and his staff who completed the data base.
Our sincere thanks to all our WE Club friends for extending their
co-operation by sending their Bio-data's photo's and getting
Advertisements and Donations.
It is said 'to err is human but to forgive is divine' in compiling the
directory of this magnitude, a lot of patience and perseverance is
required, despite that some errors are sure to have been made.
We seek your indulgence in ignoring this and hope you will beneÔÄÅt
from this guide book through the year.

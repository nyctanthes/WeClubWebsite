I thank WE Multiple District President WE Saroja Mekal for giving me the opportunity to serve the WE organization and WE Multiple as the Multiple District Secretary and I look forward to a wonderful year, working shoulder to shoulder in planning and executing and looking to the smooth functioning of the Multiple District.

Her commitment and Dedication is inspiring and we stand by her and with her in taking this organization forward to grow in strength and take it to greater heights.

We look forward to Co-operation from the District Presidents, Clubs, Multiple District Chairpersons and all WE members.

WE, as a Unified Force, can add Quality, Efficiency and Effectiveness to the work that we have set out to do by taking collective responsibility and supporting our

Multiple, District and Club Leaders.

“Saksham” is a beautiful compilation of information of members , guidelines for members and a medium for communication among members. Lot of effort has gone into it by our Editorial Board and the Multiple Team and we hope that our members use it extensively for the smooth functioning of the District.

My Dear Saroj,

It gives me great pleasure to Congratulate you for having been selected to lead the high post of President of our Multiple District 323 of our Organisation 'The Association of WE Clubs of India' during the year 2019-20. Being the President of a New Organisation as WE Multiple District, brings Responsibilities and Challenges.

The challenges before us are-

How to take our Organisation to higher levels, make it more powerful, Productive, Vibrant and Expand it beyond Horizon, reach out to the maximum needy and under privileged by inviting more new members to join our Organisation.

To achieve this we will have to bring Quality both in Administration and Activities .And Quality does not happen on its own nor an accident, it's the result of high intentions, sincere efforts, intelligent directions and skill full execution. It represents the choice of many alternatives.

The potential of every Club leader and that of our members is immense. As a dedicated and efficient leader you know how to bring out the best in each of our WE member and use it your advantage. I am confident that your leadership will provide required Motivation, Enthusiasm and Confidence not only to your cabinet officers but to all the WE members of our Organisation. Your Courage, Confidence, Concentration, Passion and a strong sense of values will take our Organisation to greater Heights .

With all the best wishes to Anita Desai Jain, Manju Kochhar and the whole Editorial board and not to miss the help from M.D Micro Team (Secretaries and Treasurers) for the successful publication of M.D. Directory to be released on the occasion of M.D Installation at Goa on 3rd August, 2019

Always with you in endeavours to Seize Every Opportunity to Serve and accomplish PANCH KARMA for a better Tomorrow.

Sincerely,

**WE Kawal Savinder Rekhi** - Multiple District President 1992-9

The white in the back ground is for purity in deeds and transparency in service.

The WE in gold stands for warmth, integrity and firm values,
along with success and achievement and epitomizes the strength of women
and their ability to uplift other women.

The face of the women looking towards the left
portrays our glorious past
and on the right, projects our bright future.

The five stars describe the quality of our service.

The circle in gold is our encompassing field of work and our everlasting
and strong bonding of values and morals within the organization.
